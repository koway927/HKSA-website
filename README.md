# UIUC HKSA Website

A modern, responsive website for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Hong Kong Student Association (UIUC HKSA).


The HKSA website serves as the digital hub for the Hong Kong Student Association at UIUC. We are a registered social and cultural student organization committed to spreading awareness, understanding, and appreciation of Hong Kong culture. Our platform provides a space for Hong Kong students to connect while encouraging students from diverse cultural backgrounds to join our community.
